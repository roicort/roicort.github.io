Space has always been the object of our goals and dreams, since ancient times we find in locutions like "Ad Astra, per aspera" the desire to always go one step further. I ask myself, having everything on earth, why do we always look upwards? Perhaps it is the human desire to reach all that seems impossible or to understand the unknowable. Whatever it is, there is no doubt that the place least fit for humans, an infinite void filled with the unknown, has always been the inspiration for everything we do here.

This series of small drawings seek nothing more than to contrast the simplicity of the beautiful with the infinite, the smallness of our existence in the face of time, the importance of being here, now and never forgetting that all we have is each other.
