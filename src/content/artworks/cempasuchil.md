Cempasúchil comes from the Náhuatl "Cempohualxochitl" which 
translates to "many flowers". It's, also known as 
"flower of the Dead" beacuse of it's use in funerary rituals
as a tomb decoration since it was thought that its yellow 
and orange petals were able tokeep the heat of the sun and 
shelter the dead.

>"Luego llegó Huitzilin, en forma de un colibrí, y amoroso se posó en el centro de la flor, y al instante la flor se abrió en 20 pétalos, de aroma intenso y misterioso…" - Cempoalxochitl
