			<p class="m-0 text-muted">We stay close to the people using what we build: quick interviews, async notes, and instrumented releases. Decisions stay traceable so teams know why something shipped, not just what shipped.</p>
			<p class="m-0 text-muted">When we embed with clients, we bring our own delivery discipline—strong briefs, scoped milestones, and demos that keep stakeholders aligned. The goal: fewer surprises, faster learning.</p>
