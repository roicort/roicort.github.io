## Data

SARII has been trainned on quotes from a wide range of real authors available on [GoodReads](https://goodreads.com)

## Architecure 

SARII is based in a easy to train AWD-LSTM neural network architecure [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.02182.pdf)] which is Long short-term memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Netwrok (RNN).

## Twitter Bot

The main goal of SARII was to compete with another accounts that like to share quotes embedded on images. So the process is not only generating a quote but automating the process of searching a image from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) editing the image, putting the quote on it and sharing it on social media.

The final result looks like this
